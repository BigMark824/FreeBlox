### Decompilation of Early Roblox (2007) using [RBXGS (ver 0.3.634.0)](https://archive.org/download/rbxgssetup/S3FileHandler_RBXGSSetup_0.3.634.0.msi)

The aim of this project is to restore 2007 Roblox and potentially bring security improvements to its RBXGS component

### How do I contribute?
Pull requests are completely open, I will be working to structure contributions a bit better in the near future but for now opening a PR will be sufficient. We're currently very early in development and mainly focusing on the App project components (v8Kernel, v8World etc)
